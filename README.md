# zGo
Some tinkering in Go on z/OS. The first three items are from the language introduction on:
    https://go.dev/tour/welcome/

* hello - a "Hello World"
* calc_sqrt - a method to estimate a square root, showing loops
* fibonacci - looping to produce a fibonacci sequence
* goGetDepartments - an HTTP REST call to DB2 for z/OS
